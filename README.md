# STrCryst
The slip trace crystallography (STrCryst) toolbox is developed for crystallographic analysis for plastically deformed metallic materials.

# Why we developed this software
Metals and alloys undergo plastic deformation once the external load exceeds their yield strengths. One of the conspicuous features resulting from this, are the surface steps produced by various deformation micro-events, such as dislocation slip, mechanical twinning, or displacive phase transformations. In a microscopic viewpoint, these surface steps are the intersections between crystallographic planes on which plasticity mechanisms take place and the sampleâ€™s surface plane. This kind of intrinsic correlation motivates the design of this STrCryst toolbox, in a sense to enable quantitative crystallographic analysis of plastic deformation micro-mechanisms.

# What can you do in STrCryst
The current STrCryst (V1.0) toolbox developed in MATLAB includes two major functions: (1) distinguish operative deformation module by trace calculation; and (2) analyze deformation compatibility considering slip transfer incident between adjacent grains. Follow-up version of it will incorporate more functions based on the inputs and feedbacks from users. Please feel free to reach out to the developer (slwei@mit.edu), if you have any question or suggestion.
